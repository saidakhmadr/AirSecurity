A school research project that aims to improve the quality of education of students at NIS and beyond!

Project Air Security - Arduino-Based Classroom CO2 Monitoring System
Project Air Security is an innovative Arduino-based solution designed to monitor and regulate CO2 levels in classrooms. Leveraging sensors such as DHT11 and MQ135, this project aims to enhance the learning environment for students by ensuring optimal air quality.

CO2 Monitoring: The primary advantage of Project Air Security is its ability to monitor carbon dioxide levels in real-time. Elevated CO2 levels can lead to reduced cognitive function and concentration, affecting students' academic performance. By constantly measuring CO2, the system helps maintain an environment conducive to learning.

Automatic Cooling System: The project features an automatic cooling system that activates when CO2 levels reach a critical point. This not only prevents discomfort but also addresses health concerns associated with prolonged exposure to high CO2 concentrations.User-Friendly Interface: The system is designed with a user-friendly interface, allowing educators and administrators to easily interpret the data. Visual indicators and alerts make it simple to understand the current air quality status and take necessary actions.

Project Air Security addresses the common issue of inadequate ventilation in classrooms, which can lead to a buildup of CO2. By providing a proactive solution, it mitigates the negative impact of poor air quality on students' well-being and academic performance.

In conclusion, Project Air Security stands as a valuable tool for educational institutions, creating a healthier and more conducive atmosphere for learning. By tackling the problem of high CO2 levels head-on, this Arduino-based project contributes to the overall well-being and success of students and educators alike.
